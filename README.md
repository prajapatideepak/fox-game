# fox-game
I am building virtual pet toy game from 90s 

Introduction about the game:
Fox games are a category of asymmetric board games for two players, where one player is the fox and tries to eat the geese / sheep, and the opposing player directs the geese/sheep and attempts to trap the fox, or reach a destination on the board.
